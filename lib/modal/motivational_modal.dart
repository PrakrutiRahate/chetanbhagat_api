Mario Mandzukic, the guy who scored the winner last night was one.\r\n\r\nThe other was Nikola Kalinic.\r\n\r\nKalinic was on the bench for Croatia's first game against Nigeria. With five minutes to end that game, coach instructed him to dress up and replace another player.\r\n\r\nKalinic angrily refused to play, in protest of being left on the bench.\r\n\r\nHe saw himself a top player, and wouldn't come on for just five minutes. The coach turned to other player Pjaca for the substitution.\r\n\r\nAfter the match, Kalinic refused to apologize, despite appeals from other coaching staff.\r\n\r\nThe coach then sacked him from the team, and sent him home from Russia. Kalinic flew for holidays, and even posted pictures of himself enjoying elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he seem to imagine Croatia won't go anywhere in the tournament. But without him, the team managed to win their matches.\r\n\r\nCroatia achieved their greatest football achievement in history, reaching the World Cup final.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 22 players are national heroes. Their names forever inscribed in the hearts of generations.\r\n\r\nKalinic is not part of the winning team all because of minutes of anger, pride and bloated ego.\r\n\r\nHe may have regretted now but it is too late. These stories about life are quite familiar to us, but do we really learn lessons from them? As they profoundly apply to all spheres of life?\r\n\r\nLearn to cut pride, learn to control anger and deflate ego. And ultimately, learn to say SORRY.\r\n\r\nYears of sweat and dedication can all be shattered by moments of anger and pride.\r\n\r\nDon't be a Kalinic. \r\nDo have a blessed weekend",

They are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) DON'T PANIC in the event of a blowout, calm yourself down fast because your car will start misbehaving and you need to take charge.\r\n\r\n(2) Hold FIRMLY to your steering wheel with both hand, NO VIGOROUS TURNING, as you concentrate on the road and your mirrors, in seconds study the movement pattern of the car. Your car will naturally swerve to the direction of the burst tyre.\r\n\r\n(3) Gradually take off your foot from the accelerator, DON'T EVER ATTEMPT TO PRESS THE BRAKES, IF YOU DO, YOU HAVE A 95% CHANCE OF A SOMERSAULT. The car will decelerate gradually while you concentrate on the road to avoid collision with any other road user.\r\n\r\n(4) Disengage the gears of the car by shifting to neutral (N) as you still maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel and put your eyes on the road.\r\n\r\n(5) After a while depending on your initial speed, your car comes to a speed less than 60km/h when it is now safe to GRADUALLY apply the brakes and navigate to the side walk\r\n\r\n(6) Ultimately, it is now safe to put the car to a complete stop and turn off the engine. You have just saved yourself and passengers from untimely death.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nOf course, everyone in the car will be in a panic mode BUT this is NOT THE TIME TO LISTEN TO THEM, it is TIME TO CONCENTRATE.\r\n\r\nPlease, don't just read.. Share on your page and copy to other platforms, you may just be able to save a life.\r\nI pray that God will continue to keep us safe whenever we use the roads.",

The first role which I would recommend to you is to be a School Teacher.\r\nTo teach lessons to children who are not learning, you need a lot of patience.\r\nBeing a nursery or primary school teacher, even for one day, you will see how you have to increase your patience.\r\n\r\n2. Be a Gardener or spend a day with a Farmer.\r\nIf you are sowing the seeds,\r\nif you are watering the plants,\r\nyou will know how you must care for water, earth and the environment.\r\nYou will have a feeling for the environment.\r\nYou will value food and you will not waste food.\r\nYou know, what we do?\r\nWe bring so much food, and we put it in the fridge and, after a few days in the refrigerator, we throw the food.\r\nWe are wasting millions and millions of tons of food every day.\r\nWe should not waste food.\r\nThis we will learn if we spend one day being a farmer or a gardener.\r\n\r\n3. You should spend a day in the mental hospital.\r\nWhatever people talk in the mental hospital, you don’t mind.\r\nIf they scold you,\r\nif they blame you,\r\nif they curse you,\r\nwill you mind?\r\nYou don’t mind because you are aware that this person is mentally sick.\r\nYou know that many people are outside the hospital, but that does not mean they are mentally well.\r\nSo, in life, you come across people who blame you for nothing, who are jealous or angry, who say things that make no sense. Then, you know, you will have the patience to deal with them with a smile. You will not take the garbage inside and spoil your mind.\r\nSo one day if you spend in a mental hospital, you will know how to save your mind.\r\nYou will stop being a football of others’ opinions.\r\n\r\n4. One day you must go to a prison. Maybe it is shocking to you.\r\nYou don’t have to do a wrong thing to go to a prison.\r\nJust go visit a prison, spend a little time with the prisoners.\r\nYou will understand what compassion is.\r\nWhat helplessness is.\r\nThose people did a mistake without awareness.\r\nSo you will know how you must have a say on your emotions.\r\n\r\n5. There are terminally ill people in the hospital.\r\nOne day with them, and you will realize how precious life is.\r\nAnd you will start valuing health.\r\nYou will eat better,\r\nyou will exercise.\r\nYou will do all that is needed to be more vibrant in your life.\r\n\r\nWith these five days what would be the outcome?\r\n\r\nI guess from these five days you will become\r\nMore Vibrant,\r\nMore Alive,\r\nMore Loving,\r\nCompassionate\r\nand Active\r\nEnjoy your Life",

//         "text_stories": "Very informative technique...:\r\n5 Cell Phone Tricks!\r\n\r\n1. Emergency Services: If you find yourself out of the coverage area of your mobile network and there is an emergency, just dial 112 and your mobile will establish your contact with any existing network in that area! Surprisingly, the emergency number 112 can be dialed even if the keypad is locked! \r\nThis works on all phones worldwide and is free, too!!\r\n\r\n2. Locked your keys in the car:\r\nIf you lock your remote keyless car keys in the car and the spare keys are at home, call someone at home on their mobile phone from your cell phone. Hold your cell phone about a foot from your car door and have the person at your home press the unlock button on the spare key, holding it near the mobile phone on his/ her end. Your car will unlock, even if you are thousands of miles away!!\r\n\r\n3. In case of mobile phone battery flat:\r\n\r\nAll cell phones have Hidden Battery Power.\r\nTo activate, press the keys *3370# (remember the asterisk). Do this when the phone is almost dead. Your mobile will restart in a special way with this new reserve and it will show a 50% increase in battery life. This reserve will be recharged when you charge your handphone next time. This secret is in the fine print in most phone manuals, which we often skip without realizing!\r\n\r\n4. Disabling a STOLEN mobile:\r\n\r\nTo check your mobile phone's serial number, key in following digits on your phone: \r\n*#06#. A 15 digits code will appear on the screen that is unique to your handset. Write it down and keep it somewhere safe. If your handphone is ever stolen, phone your service provider and give them this code. They will then be able to block your handset so even if the SIM is changed, your handphone will be totally useless. Maybe you don't get your phone back but it can't be used/ resold either. \r\nThis secret is in the fine print of most mobile phone manuals. It was created for the very purpose of trying to prevent phones from being stolen.\r\n\r\n5. ATM PIN Number Reversal:\r\n\r\nIf you ever be forced by a robber to withdraw money from an ATM machine, you can notify the police by entering your PIN # in reverse order. For example, if your PIN Number is 1234 but you should instead put 4321. The ATM system recognizes that your PIN # is backwards from the ATM card you placed in the machine. The machine will still give you the money you requested for but unknown to the robber, the police will be immediately dispatched to the location. Beware all ATM’s carry this emergency sequencer by law. It is, however, seldomly used as people just don't know about it!! ?\r\n\r\nPass this info to family & friends!",

While normal medical checks revealed nothing wrong in him, deeper probes revealed the reason – his stomach was collecting significant amounts of wax. And doctors identified the villain – the ordinary disposable paper cups he used for drinking his tea at his office pantry. Disposable paper cups have become quite popular in office pantries due to the convenience it offers. What many overlook is the fact that these paper cups are coated with a tiny layer of wax, which is essential to prevent water from seeping into the paper. When very hot liquids are pour over this cup, the paper cups wax may disintegrate and a little may come off, which will promptly be sent along with the drink into our stomachs! While our body can discard minor amounts, over the long-term, it does become a problem. So what can be done about it? You can try to bring your own glass cups. Glass is one of the least reactive materials in the world (remember acids are stored in glass vessels, blood samples are collected in glass plates – these are for a good reason). But glass does have the problem of breaking easily, so it requires good care. Ceramic cups are probably the best bet. Of course, you can also use your ordinary stainless steel glass, but never use plastic ones – they are harmful, and its dangers are even worse than wax.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT USE DISPOSABLE CUPS (Plastic or paper) for hot drinks like tea, coffee and milk.",

Now can we please go home?” Meera pleaded.\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Let’s go.” Raj answered.\r\n\r\nRaj and Meera sat inside the car while Raj drove back to their home from the mall. Around two hours later, the doorbell buzzed.\r\n\r\n“Raj, open the door.” Meera shouted from the bedroom.\r\n\r\n“Are you kidding? Virat is on 99.” Raj answered while looking at television in the hall.\r\n\r\nMeera came out of her bedroom and opened the door. The courier guy handed her the courier which had her name on it.\r\n\r\nFirst, she was surprised as she hadn’t ordered anything in those days. But, when she opened it, she found the same designer dress which she was gazing at while sipping her coffee.\r\n\r\nThe smart girl understood everything. She turned back to Raj’s side and asked Raj, “Why?”\r\n\r\nRaj, who was already turned towards to the door side answered, “Because, you liked it.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t even tell you. Then, how did you know that I was looking at the dress and I like it?”\r\n\r\nRaj smiled and answered, “Because, I was only looking at you.”\r\n\r\nThe century celebration moment happened on both on & off screen.",

You’ll be in relationships that make you feel lonely, unloved and disrespected. And although you’ve probably already given yourself a hoard of excuses to hang in there, know when to let go. Understand that it is not selfish to care about your own happiness; that just because they haven’t, doesn’t mean it is unimportant.\r\n\r\nYou deserve better, you deserve someone who’ll make you feel good about yourself, who’ll help you move towards your dreams and be so savagely proud of you at every step you take. Find someone you’ll not have to give excuses to be with. Love, after all, should not be such a hard thing to do. It is not a competition. It is not a series of anxiety attacks. Love should be the home you always come back to, and stay.\r\n\r\nThere are thirty-seven trillion cells functioning together to create your beautiful body. There is so much love, so many experiences, learnings and dreams that went into building this person that you are today. You are strong. There’s a lot you can do in life. There is a lot more that you can do in life.\r\n\r\nSo move out and move on. One day it’ll stop hurting. One day you’ll look back and be proud of how far you’ve come from where you used to be. Give it time. Forgive. You have too much to look forward to in life to be consumed by the struggles of your past. You’re not a tragedy, you’re healing and it’s beautiful.",

//         "text_stories": "Some very important financial tips that everyone should know ....\r\n\r\n1. Avoid buying property on loans as it eats most of your earnings unless you have a clear plan for its repayment. It's important to monitor cash flow. Though, the house will be your asset, your liability will be much more.\r\n\r\n2. Start a SIP at a very young age. Try to save atleast 15–25 % of your earnings.\r\n\r\n3. Avoid buying a car unless you use it everyday.\r\n.\r\n4. Do not let this sentence scare you. “Mutual fund investment are subject to market risk. Please read the offer documents carefully before investing”. Most people avoid investing in mutual funds just because of this one warning. Yes, there is a market risk, but look at the history and growth of mutual funds.\r\n\r\n5. Try having a simple wedding.\r\n\r\n6. Atleast 20% of your wealth should be liquid so you can utilize it when necessary.\r\n\r\n7. Considering inflation, you are actually losing money if it is in savings bank account. Do not keep huge money in savings bank account.\r\n\r\n8. If you invest in stocks, pay due attention.\r\n\r\n9. If you invest in stocks have a separate account for delivery investment and Intraday investment. It is easy to monitor this way and also makes tax calculation easy\r\n\r\n10. Do not have a belief that property and car make you rich. Its what you save and invest, that is important.\r\n\r\n11. Never invest in insurance for returns. Insurance is not an investment option. It is a risk management tool.\r\n\r\n12. Never use credit cards for lavish spending. Use credit cards intelligently and for needs not for wants.\r\n\r\n13. Cancel all credit cards before you die. Or inform family about all your accounts, credit cards, loans and saving now itself. Even a small residue will cost your family much.\r\n\r\n14. Invest on yourself and then on other investments.\r\n\r\n15. Always try to balance your earnings with your savings first, then on spending and loans. Never take unnecessary loans. Always have reserve and utilise them and unless no other go never take loan.\r\n\r\n16. Always have a plan for future events on your career, life, spending and finance.\r\n\r\n17. Always have a reserve on your savings for contingency and urgent situations.\r\n\r\n18. Your personal life and health are the most important investment. Do have a regular health check and do healthy workout every day. Stay healthy and live happily.",

I just did !\r\n\r\nDr Stephen Mak treats terminal ill cancer patients by an \"un-orthodox\" way and many patients recovered.\r\n\r\nBefore he used solar energy to clear the illnesses of his patients, he believes on natural healing in the body against illnesses. See his article below.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the strategies to heal cancer. As of late, my success rate in curing cancer is about 80%.\r\n\r\nCancer patients shouldn't die. The cure for cancer is already found - *its in the way we eat fruits.*\r\n\r\nIt is whether you believe it or not.\r\n\r\nI am sorry for the hundreds of cancer patients who die under the conventional treatments.\r\n\r\n*EATING FRUIT*\r\n\r\nWe all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths.\r\n\r\nIt's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and *when* to eat the fruits.\r\n\r\nWhat is the correct way of eating fruits?\r\n\r\n*IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS!*\r\n\r\n*FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH*\r\n\r\nIf you eat fruits on empty stomach, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities.\r\n\r\n_FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD._\r\n\r\nLet's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so due to the bread taken before the fruit.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the whole meal of bread & fruit rots and ferments and turns to acid.\r\n\r\nThe minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.\r\n\r\nSo please eat your fruits on an *empty stomach* *or before your meals !*\r\n\r\nYou have heard people complaining :\r\n\r\nEvery time I eat watermelon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet, etc.. etc..\r\n\r\nActually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on _an empty stomach._\r\n\r\nThe fruit mixes with the putrefying of other food and produces gas and hence you will bloat !\r\n\r\nGreying hair, balding, nervous outburst and dark circles under the eyes all these will *NOT* *happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.*\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter.\r\n\r\nIf you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the *SECRET of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.*\r\n\r\nWhen you need to drink fruit juice - *drink only fresh fruit juice,* NOT from the cans, packs or bottles.\r\n\r\nDon't even drink juice that has been heated up.\r\n\r\nDon't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all.\r\n\r\nYou only get its taste.\r\nCooking destroys all the vitamins.\r\n\r\nBut eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice.\r\n\r\nIf you should drink the fresh fruit juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it.\r\n\r\nYou can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse or detoxify your body.\r\n\r\nJust eat fruits and drink fresh fruit juice throughout the 3 days.\r\n\r\nAnd you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look !\r\n\r\n*KIWI fruit:*\r\nTiny but mighty. \r\nThis is a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin E & fiber. Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange.\r\n\r\n*APPLE:*\r\nAn apple a day keeps the doctor away? \r\nAlthough an apple has a low vitamin C content, it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby _helping to lower the risks of colon cancer, heart attack & stroke._\r\n\r\n*STRAWBERRY:*\r\nProtective Fruit. \r\nStrawberries have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect the body from cancer-causing, blood vessel-clogging and free radicals.\r\n\r\n*ORANGE ????\r\nSweetest medicine. \r\nTaking 2-4 oranges a day may _help keep colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessens the risk of colon cancer._\r\n\r\n*WATERMELON:*\r\nCoolest thirst quencher. Composed of 92% water, it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione, which _helps boost our immune system._\r\n\r\nThey are also *a key source of lycopene the cancer fighting oxidant.*\r\nOther nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium.\r\n\r\n*GUAVA & PAPAYA:*\r\nTop awards for vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high vitamin C content.\r\n\r\nGuava is also rich in fiber, which _helps prevent constipation._\r\n\r\nPapaya is rich in carotene; this is _good for your eyes._\r\n\r\n*Drinking COLD water or drinks after a meal = CANCER*\r\n\r\nCan you believe this ?\r\n\r\nFor those who like to drink cold water or cold drinks, this article is applicable to you.\r\n\r\nIt is nice to have a cup of cold water or cold drinks after a meal.\r\n\r\n*However, the cold water or drinks will solidify the oily stuff that you have just eaten.*\r\n\r\n*It will slow down the digestion.*\r\n\r\n*Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food.*\r\n\r\n*It will line the intestine.*\r\n\r\n*Very soon, this will turn into FATS and lead to CANCER !*\r\n\r\n_*It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.*_\r\n\r\nLet's be careful and be aware. The more we know the better chance we could survive.\r\n\r\nA cardiologist says: \r\nif everyone who gets this mail sends it to 10 people, you can be sure that we'll save at least one life.\r\n\r\nSo lets do it !!!",

My daughter, just the other day, asked to borrow my shoes. Yes, the kids are now that old. \r\nI wasn't quite ready to accept it. So, I did what we sensible mothers all do when we think our kids are growing up too fast- I pulled out the baby albums and found myself running my fingers over their baby pictures. My eyes turned moist, with humble pride at the wonderful people they had become but also because I missed their baby days! What exactly did I miss, I asked myself. The sleep deprived nights? The constant 'clingy'ness? The diapers and the potty training? \r\nHonestly, I miss all of that and then some!\r\nI miss their touch. I miss their weight in my arms. I miss how my son needed my earlobe to pull on when he fell asleep every night - I couldn't wear earrings for an entire year! I miss my little girl who hated to nap and fell asleep only bit by bit, her body reluctantly and gradually growing heavier my arms as she drifted off. \r\nI miss their fragrance. That heady mix of baby soap, spit-up, wet diaper and innocence! That special baby smell that no one can replicate. One whiff of it could recharge me for the entire day!\r\nI miss their tears. It is not that they don't cry now. But now, their tears make me hurt. I can console them but not always make them feel better. Back then, I was the only one who could. I miss the mommy power of taking all their troubles away.\r\nI miss their littleness. Just yesterday, my son walked over to the sofa and unexpectedly lay his head in my lap. I cherished the moment as I ran my fingers through his hair but craved the time when his entire little being fit comfortably in my lap. I miss the tiny fists boxing in the air, the first shoes smaller than my palm. \r\nI miss how, no matter what they were doing, their mom radar would always check to see if I was around.\r\nMoms, don't miss the opportunity to make the most of your time with the little ones while they are still little. Cuddle them, squish them, smell the top of their heads, shower them with a hundred kisses! Let your clothes soak up their tears and let their grubby fingers ruin your hair as they fling their arms around you. Store each moment in your memory because no pictures will ever do them justice.\r\nTrust me, time flies. Soon, these days will seem like a distant dream and you will wish for them all over again!",

They have absolutely no idea about housecleaning or laundry or how to look after themselves.\r\nThey forever have to live on the mercies of others. This is so sad. I know of grown men who will never be able to go on a trip, be it for work or pleasure, if their wives do not pack their suitcase for them. \r\nThere is an entire generation of Indian men who would literally starve to death if left on their own. \r\nI always thought parents loved all their children equally. But that is clearly not the case. They raise daughters who can take care of themselves and will survive under any conditions....but they raise sons to be helpless and without any life skills.\r\nI think we should start a petition for equal rights for men at home. \r\n????????????????\r\n\r\nDon't laugh....think about it....while Indian women are all set to conquer Mars, our poor boys will die a slow death because nobody showed them how to turn on the cooking gas!\r\n????????????\r\n\r\n",

Do not confront her. Do not slap her with more abuse. Give way for her and walk beside her. May be hold her hands and walk for a while.

Let’s say it’s 7:45pm and you’re going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.\r\n\r\n2. You’re really tired, upset and frustrated.\r\n\r\n3. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home.\r\n\r\n4. Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ll be able to make it that far.\r\n\r\n5. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy who taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.\r\n\r\n6. HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?\r\nSince many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only\r\nabout 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.\r\n\r\n7. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing\r\nrepeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.\r\n\r\nA breath and a cough must be repeated about every two\r\nseconds without let-up until help arrives, or until\r\nthe heart is felt to be beating normally again.\r\n\r\n8. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing\r\nmovements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital.\r\n\r\n9. Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!!\r\n\r\n10. A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mail\r\nkindly send it to 10 people, you can bet that we’ll save at least one life.\r\n\r\n11.
